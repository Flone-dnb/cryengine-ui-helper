# CRYENGINE UI Helper

TODO: screenshot

Generate `.gfx` and `.xml` files for your UI `.swf` file in just a few clicks.

# Features

- generate `.gfx` and `.xml` in just 2-3 clicks:
    - specify path to `GFxExport` (only need to do this once),
    - select `.swf` file,
    - click `Generate .gfx and .xml files`.
- remembers the specified path to `GFxExport` binary and the specified additional `GFxExport` arguments so you don't have to enter them again and again,
- if an `.xml` file already exists at the output location, you will be asked if you want to get this file's XML data on screen (read UI parameters from `.xml` file), so if you are regenerating `.xml` file you don't have to enter old data again.
